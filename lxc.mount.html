# Exposing a directory on the host machine to an LXC container

1. Log into the container and create an empty directory, this will be the mount point
1. Log out and stop the container.
1. Open to your container's config file
    * For regular LXC containers: `/var/lib/lxc/mycontainer/config`
    * For *unprivileged* LXC containers: `$HOME/.local/share/lxc/mycontainer/config`
1. Add a new line above the `lxc.mount` directive, that follows the format below. Substitute proper paths as necessary:
    * `lxc.mount.entry = /path/to/folder/on/host /path/to/mount/point none bind 0 0`
    * Both of these paths are **relative to the host machine**.
    * Location of the root fs in the container can be found at:
        * For regular LXC containers: `/var/lib/lxc/mycontainer/rootfs/`
        * For *unprivileged* LXC containers: `$HOME/.local/share/lxc/mycontainer/rootfs`

**Note**: If the host's user does not exist in the container, the container will still be mounted, but with `nobody:nogroup` as the owner. This may not be a problem unless you need to write to these files, in which case you'll need to give everybody write permission to that folder. (i.e. `chmod -R go+w /folder/to/share`)

## Example

I want to share `/home/julianlam/foobar` to my *unprivileged* container `bazquux`. In `bazquux`, I want this folder to be found at `/mnt/baz`.

In the container:

``` bash
$ cd /mnt
$ sudo mkdir baz
$ logout
```

In the host, I will add the following line above `lxc-mount` in `/home/julianlam/.local/share/lxc/bazquux/config`:

```
lxc.mount.entry = /home/julianlam/foobar /home/julian/.local/share/lxc/bazquux/rootfs/mnt/baz none bind 0 0

```

Then

``` bash
$ lxc-start -n bazquux -d
```
